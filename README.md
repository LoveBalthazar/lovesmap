Maps Javascript API

This project is a basic demonstration of how Maps JavaScript API from GCP Marketplace can be incorporated into a website.

The website is for demonstration purposes. The HTML template (adapted from W3Schools) can be used as a base for your own project replacing the API key with yours, and of course using your creativity to design your own project.

The website shows an example of how Maps JavaScript API is used to point to different cities in New Orleans, Louisiana including markers.

The HTML cities pages includes the full codes without the API Key. You will replace this section with your own API Key. The pointer images on the site are inactive and not linked to any page.
